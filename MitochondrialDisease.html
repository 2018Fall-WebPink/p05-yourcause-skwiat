                <p> Mitochondrial disease results from failures of the mitochondria and are responsible for creating more than 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support organ function. When they fail, less energy is generated within the cell which can cause cell injury and even cell death. If this process is repeated throughout the body, whole organ systems begin to fail. The parts of the body, such as the heart, brain, muscles and lungs, requiring the greatest amounts of energy are the most affected.  Mitochondrial disease is difficult to diagnose because it affects each individual differently. If three or more organ systems are involved, mitochondrial disease should be suspected and primarily affects children.</p>

            <h2> Types of Mitochondrial Diseases </h2>
            
                <p> There are thousands of different types of Mitochondrial diseases, but only a few that are specific and well known. For example, <b>Alpers disease</b> causes seizures, dementia, blindness, liver dysfunction, and cerebral. Another example would be <b>Creatine Deficiency</b> which results in mental retardation, seizures, speech delay, and additonal setbacks. </p>

            <h2> Why I Support This Cause </h2>

            <img id="walk" src="walk.jpg"
             alt="logo for mito walk"
             title="Walk for a Cure" />
            
                <p> This cause interst me because in my family, we have a close friend who recently was diagnosed with Mitochondrial disease. He is a young boy who is not able to walk, talk, or take care of himself at all. Him and his family are truly an inspiration to me because even though they are going through such a rough time, they are always happy and ready to help others in need. Each year I attend a walk to find a cure for Mito, and help raise/donate money towards the cause. I feel like so much time and effort could be dedicated towards Mitochondrial disease, and I hope one day a cure will be found to save many children and young adults. </p>
